Description: Debian theme and settings for the Calamares Installer
 Calamares is a generic installer framework for Linux distributions.
 By default, it contains a set of boilerplate wording and images. This
 package provides the latest Debian artwork as well as scripts that
 supports EFI installations.

 It also serves as an example for how derivatives can create their own
 calamares-settings packages.
